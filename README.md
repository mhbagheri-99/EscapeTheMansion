# Escape The Mansion
## _A very short puzzle game demo_

This was my first ever project in _Unreal Engine 5_. I mostly focused on getting to know the editor itself, the blueprint visual programming feature, and C++ programming in UE. The main idea is that the player would explore a room and tries to inspect the objects and find the useful ones to solve the problems such as unlocking a door or playing the music on a record player and eventually finding out about a HUGE and PRECIOUS surprise that was hidden all along.

## Implemented Features

- Player is taken from the unreal engine learning content for fps
- Grabbing and Releasing the Grabbable objects in the scenery
- Interface for picking up (NOT grabbing) the objects or interacting with the other components like openning a door
- Door opening and closing animation with lurp in blueprints
- Locked Door System in blueprints
- Mover Component that can be called when objects are triggered (like moving an object by putting something on a pressure plate or putting a piece of something back to it)

## Upcoming and possible features

Some features that I am planning to implement and add to the game and publish are as follows:

- Setting up a hint system for interactive objects, such as glowing translucent skin on them which can be permenant or triggered by pressing H for hints
- Add a menu with settings to the game
- An inspection system, like when hovering over an object shows the available action such as pick up, grab or open
- Add a text system to tell a little story about the game to make it a more immersive experience
- Adding more sound effects to the level, such as foot steps while walking or interacting with objects (Locked door, picking up the key and sliding wall sound effect is already done)
- Add an slotting and unslotting Mechanism
- Add Music playing feature to the Record Player object
- And finally more puzzles and a longer playtime
